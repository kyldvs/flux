 * This store allows defining an initial state and reducing a stream of actions
 * over it. A simple implementation might look like this:
 *
 *   class FooStore extends FluxMapStore {
 *     getInitialState() {
 *       return 0;
 *     }
 *
 *     reduce(state, action) {

 *           return state * state;
 *         default:
 *           return state;
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 * We recommend using an immutable structure for your state. If you do not, be
 * sure to override areEqual to handle the shape of your state object.
